The new.website editor is your powerful tool for creating and customizing your website. Through our intuitive chat interface, you can build, modify, and enhance your site using simple conversational commands.

## Messages Interface

All communication with the editor happens through our chat interface. You can send messages to make changes to your website, such as:

- "Change the text to 'Welcome to our new product launch'"
- "Add a contact form to the bottom of the page"
- "Make the header background blue"
- "Create a new section with pricing information"
- "Update the hero image to something more modern"

The editor understands natural language commands and will implement your requested changes automatically, making website creation as simple as having a conversation.

## Library

You can access your media and content through the Library feature by clicking "Show Library" without altering any ongoing processes. The library provides easy access to all your assets organized in two main categories:

### Media

/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/features/editor/library-1.png"
  alt="Library Media View"
/>

The Media tab shows all your uploaded images and media files. You can browse through your media collection and select files to use in your website.

### Content

  alt="Library Content View"
/>

The Content tab displays all your written content, articles, and text assets that you can reference and reuse across your website.

### Referencing Assets in Chat

  alt="Referenced Content in Chat"
/>

When you click on either media or content from the library, it will show up in the chat as a reference, allowing you to easily incorporate it into your instructions.

### Quick Access with @ Commands

You can also quickly access your media and content directly in the chat by typing:

- **@** - Opens the full media and content selector
- **@m:** - Opens up media files specifically
- **@c:** - Opens up content specifically

Once you click on any item from these menus, it will be referenced in your chat message, making it easy to incorporate your existing assets into new instructions.
