  <Accordion title="How does it work?">
    Simply describe your website idea in the text box on our landing page. Our AI will analyze your idea and generate a complete website draft in just minutes. From there, you can describe changes that you want to make, add content, media, and forms to collect information from your users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does the AI take to design my website?">
    Usually about six minutes for the first draft. Get a cup of coffee while you wait! Edits afterwards are much faster if they're simple, but can also take a few minutes if they're very complex.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize my website after it is created?">
    Absolutely! After your website is first created, you will have access to the editor where you can customize every aspect of your site including design, content, and functionality in more detail.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it make mobile-friendly websites?">
    Yes! By default, everything our AI outputs should work on both desktop and mobile. We give you previews for both, so it's easy to configure and spot issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from other website builders?">
    There are lots of website builders out there, like Wix, Webflow, Squarespace, Bubble, Wordpress, Framer, Typedream, and hundreds more. The main difference is that all those tools require you to configure page-by-page yourself in their editor, which makes for a clunky experience. What's magical about new.website is that our AI generates all the pages and adjusts everything automatically for you. All you need to supply is the design direction and media files. What would've taken many hours to set up in Webflow or Squarespace our AI will handle for you in minutes. This makes things like adding hundreds of blog posts, or complete website redesigns, super easy with us.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need technical skills to use this platform?">
    No technical skills required! Our platform is designed to be user-friendly for everyone. Simply describe your idea, and our AI handles all the technical aspects of creating your website.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a way for technical users to edit the source code?">
    You can use our editor to make precise changes, but for more convenience, we also offer a GitHub integration. When your website is created, we make a private GitHub repository for it, and we can provide you with access to it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is new.website a full-stack website builder, or only front-end?">
    We're focused on making websites, which means that our tool mostly serves to build beautiful front-end experiences. This includes a "light" back-end. You can build out some back-end logic and web application functionality, but (at least for now!) our editor doesn't give you ways to manage true back-end components, like API keys, database access, environment variables, etc. Generally, user authentication is the barrier that you currently can't cross with new.website.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a database integration?">
    We allow you to create unlimited forms on your website, and we give you a simple view and export functionality for those records. Beyond that, we currently do not provide a formal database.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about security?">
    Thanks to the design decisions we've made around not providing a formal database or back-end, we've cut out many of the pitfalls where users otherwise go wrong. For now, we recommend against using "secret" API keys to third-party services on our platform. (We'll have a good way to manage those secrets soon.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    It's free to get started! For more advanced use, we offer different pricing plans for additional features and access. Check out our [Pricing](/pricing) page for detailed information on features and costs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about domains?">
    By default, every website you create will have a domain like "https://example.public.website". You can also bring your domain, like "https://example.com". Our editor makes it easy for you to direct your domain to your website.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a Content Management System (CMS)?">
    Yes! We have implemented a lightweight, simple CMS that makes it easy for you to upload and integrate all your media, whether those are text blog posts, images, PDFs, etc. You can direct the AI to pull those in exactly where they should be.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What media formats can I upload to the CMS?">
    For textual media (like blog posts, about pages, etc.) we support text files (.txt), markdown (.md) and Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx) files. For other media, we support common image formats like .png, .jpg, .jpeg, video formats like .mp4, and .pdf.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I copy an existing website?">
    Mostly! You can give our AI a website to refer to, and it'll look at it and refer to it. It won't crawl the whole site or copy their media assets, but it'll try to replicate the styles and deliver a similar experience. Do note that in order to really replicate a website, you'll need to port over the media assets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I best guide the AI on style?">
    Be precise when you can! For example, tell it exactly the names of fonts you want it to use, or the hex colors for various components. If you need help looking up colors, you can just Google for a hex color picker.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I get support?">
