## Custom Domain

Connect your own domain to your new.website project for a professional web presence. Instead of using the default `your-project.public.website` URL, you can use your own domain like `yourcompany.com`.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure DNS Settings">
    Once you've added your domain, you'll need to configure your DNS settings with your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.).

    **DNS Configuration Required:**

    | Type | Name | Value | TTL |
    |------|------|-------|-----|
    | A | @ | 76.76.21.21 | 300 |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update DNS with Your Provider">
    1. Log into your domain registrar's control panel
    2. Navigate to DNS management or DNS settings
    3. Add an A record with the values shown in the table above:
       - **Type**: A
       - **Name**: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
       - **Value**: 76.76.21.21
       - **TTL**: 300 (or the lowest available value)
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/features/custom-domain/step-4.png" alt="DNS configuration example in Cloudflare" />
    </Frame>
    
    This example shows how it looks in Cloudflare.com. Other domain providers like Namecheap or GoDaddy will have similar interfaces but may look different.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Your Domain">
    1. After updating your DNS settings, return to the new.website dashboard
    2. Click the **"Verify Domain"** button
    3. The verification process may take up to 12 hours due to DNS propagation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Finished">
    Once verification is complete, your domain should have a "Verified" badge next to it, indicating it's working properly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **DNS Propagation**: Domain changes can take up to 12 hours to propagate globally. If verification fails initially, wait a few hours and try again.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If a TTL value of 300 is not available with your DNS provider, choose the lowest available value to speed up propagation.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Verifying

- **Wait for propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 12 hours
- **Check DNS settings**: Ensure the A record is correctly configured
- **Clear DNS cache**: Try accessing your domain from an incognito/private browser window
- **Contact support**: If issues persist after 24 hours, contact support at hello@new.website

### Subdomain Setup

If you want to use a subdomain (like `app.yourcompany.com`), use the subdomain name instead of `@` in the Name field when setting up your DNS A record.

## Domain Management

Once verified, you can:
- **Remove domains**: Click the "Remove Domain" button to disconnect a domain
- **Add multiple domains**: Connect multiple domains to the same project
- **Monitor status**: See verification status with the "Verified" badge

<Tip>
  Consider setting up both the www and non-www versions of your domain by adding both `yourcompany.com` and `www.yourcompany.com` as separate domain entries.
