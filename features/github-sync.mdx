## How Sync Works

Once connected, any changes you make in new.website will automatically sync to your GitHub repository. Similarly, changes made directly in GitHub will be reflected in your new.website project, allowing you to work seamlessly between both platforms.

This bidirectional sync enables you to:

- Edit content using new.website's visual editor
- Make code changes directly in GitHub
- Collaborate with team members using GitHub's pull request workflow
- Maintain a complete version history of your project

## Next Steps

With GitHub sync enabled, you can now:

- Invite collaborators to your GitHub repository
- Set up automated deployments from GitHub
- Use GitHub's issue tracking and project management tools
- Create branches for feature development
